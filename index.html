	<p>Conway confirmed to The Associated Press that the tweet was authentic. His comments came days after he announced he was withdrawing from consideration for a top Justice Department post.

His wife took a different approach. During a Monday morning appearance on the Today Show, Kellyanne Conway condemned the medias obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.

Trump supporters have long touted his unfiltered tweets and other communications as an unparalleled advantage. Yet some allies are now urging caution given the legal questions shadowing the White House.

My personal view is that there should be a review process because of the sensitivity of so many of them, said Chris Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trump and CEO of the conservative outlet Newsmax.

White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that she was not aware of the presidents tweets being vetted by lawyers before being blasted out to the world.

White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short, meanwhile, insisted the presidents efforts were often very effective and said Trump was elected because voters were hungry for a non-conformist candidate who would change the culture in Washington.


And so he may not have a conventional style in doing that, but many of his efforts are extremely helpful to us in getting our legislation accomplished, Short said.

As part of the White Houses efforts to recalibrate, Sanders is taking on a more visible role at daily briefings instead of press secretary Sean Spicer, who has gained national celebrity for his often combative interactions with reporters. While Spicer did appear in the briefing room last week, his appearances were brief, including a 12-minute question-and-answer session that the White House would not allow to be aired on television.
